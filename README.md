An implementation of Goal Structure Notation (GSN) for MetaEdit+ (www.metacase.com/download).  
•	.mec file includes the metamodel and example models following GSN version 2 (2018) 
•	.mxs file includes library symbols

After importing these two files into MetaEdit+ you may apply GSN and integrate the goal structures for other models/modeling languages. For importing choose Repository | Import... (https://www.metacase.com/support/55/manuals/meplus/Mp-5_3_2.html).

MetaEdit+ provides functionality for collaborative modeling, versioning, model checking and publishing goal structures. Moreover, since MetaEdit+ supports domain-specific languages and comes with predefined languages (DFD, UML, ER, BPMN etc.) elements in GSN can be integrated with other specifications.
